      <p>World hunger has been a consistent problem in the modern era for many decades now. Various factors such as conflict, socio-economic conditions,
        natural hazards, climate change and pests have always challenged the nourishment of people across the globe. While many underdeveloped nations have
        faced food shortages, nourishing all of your citizens is still a problem even in the U.S.A.</p>

      <p>Despite there being enough food produced worldwide to feed everyone, over 690 million people go hungry worldwide. The UN estimates that 122 million
        of 144 million stunted children live in countries affected by conflict and an estimated 14 million children under the age of five worldwide suffer
        from severe acute malnutrition.</p>
