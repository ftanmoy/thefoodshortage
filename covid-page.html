            Covid-19 has impacted the the world in many ways, especially the economy. The most people impacted were who
            worked for minimum wage.

        <li>
            Data from several sources show a dramatic increase in the number of households struggling to put enough food
            on the table. Some 24 million adults — 11 percent of all adults in the country — reported that their
            household sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat in the last seven days, according to Household Pulse
            Survey data collected January 20 – February 1. This was far above the pre-pandemic rate: a recent survey
            released by the Agriculture Department found that 3.4 percent of adults reported that their household had
            “not enough to eat” at some point over the full 12 months of 2019. When asked why, 80 percent said they
            “couldn’t afford to buy more food,” rather than (or in addition to) non-financial factors such as lack of
            transportation or safety concerns due to the pandemic.
